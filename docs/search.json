I have always had a love for baseball as it was my favorite sport to play growing up. However, as I got older I realized how interesting the finances within the MLB are. There’s no salary cap in the MLB meaning that teams can spend whatever they want on whoever they want. This dynamic is unlike any other sport and intrigued me to evaluate how much of an advantage this gives to teams in a big market over those that don’t have alot of money to spend.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nData set Description:\nWe will be referencing a parent dataset referred to as Standard MLB Data. The Standard MLB data contains all 30 MLB teams’ win totals, Payrolls, and playoff outcomes for every season from 2000 to 2021*. In this dataset, however, we omit 2020 and 2022 due to the shortened season and deference of team payroll in 2020 and due to the extended playoff format of both years. Wins are displayed as a whole number between 0 and 162, the number of games in a typical season (occasionally a 163 must be played), Payroll is displayed as a number between 0 and 300 and is expressed in millions of dollars (81.45 means 81,450,000 dollars), the year is represented as numbers 2000-2019 & 2021, Team is the name of the team (ex. Yankees, Mets, etc.), and Playoffs is a binary operator of values 0-5 indicating the playoff success as follows and printing the expressions in quotation marks: 0 = “Missed” (Missed Playoffs), 1 = “Lost WC” (lost the wildcard game), 2 = “Lost DS” (Lost League Divisional Series), 3 = “Lost CS” (Lost League Championship Series), 4 = “Lost WS” (Lost World Series), and 5 = “Won WS” (Won World Series).\nAdditionally, we will address two other notable adaptations of this parent data which are referred to as WS winners and Averaged MLB Data respectively. WS winners is simply just a subset of the data that contains only teams that have won at least one world series in the years we are observing; the variables all remain the same in this dataset. Averaged MLB data refers to only the average number of wins and average annual payroll for all 30 MLB teams and introduces two new variables avg_wins & avg_payroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we see a very raw visualization of the Payroll and Wins of all MLB Teams from every season in the years given in the dataset. There are 600 data points here, 30 teams for all 20 seasons, and we can see what appears to be a generally positive correlation between payroll spending and regular season wins. Additionally, as one can see in the legend, the points are shaped to reflect different postseason successes, a trend we seek to explore further by looking more closely at some subsets of this massive dataset.\nLet’s Filter This Plot A Bit!\n<iframe src=“https://rconnect.bucknell.edu/content/17902463-0f42-4d9d-b0e7-94bcbd2e8670” class=“l-screen-inset shaded” height=“1000px”>\n\n\n\nIt is here where we subset the data into Teams that have won the World Series (WS winners) to juxtapose the overall payroll distributions between them. Who are the big spenders? Who are the teams that won on a budget? These boxplots show total payroll over the 20 seasons in the dataset and show the caliber of spending it took all teams to eventually find themselves winning a world series. Looking back up to the first plot, which teams have spent the most without a world series win? We can evaluate every teams payroll distribution in relation to others.\n\n\n\nIn the aforementioned data set description, we talked about evaluating the relationship between MLB Payroll and Wins for not only the standard MLB data, but a normalized average MLB data set, and the World series winner subset depicted above in the box plots.\nLet’s take a look at these relationships: <iframe src=“https://rconnect.bucknell.edu/content/d3a26d78-92d5-406a-a2d1-2e5aa281ec53” class=“l-screen-inset shaded” height=“1000px”>\n\n\n\nHere, we condense the three regression lines condensed from the previous plot to see how different they truly are. We see that there is a shockingly similar slope coefficient between the World Series Winners and the Standard MLB data. Both are raw data and both display the subjective nature and intense variability that sports employ. However, we see that the normalized or Averaged MLB Data employs a much steeper linear relationship. It is in this plot, that we can visualize the differences and similarities detailed in the descriptions of the individual plots.\nConclusion About Spending and Wins in The MLB:\nThere’s a 30 million dollar difference between the average payroll of the Standard MLB Data and the average payroll of the World Series Winners (90 million compared to 120 million). Reiterating, the correlations between Payroll and Wins for the three categories of data used are as follows: Standard: ~.3, World Series Winners: ~.5, and Averaged: ~.7. Given this information, it seems that spending money on signing big free agents does equate to wins. Although the extent may not be as highly correlated through the standard data set, one cannot ignore the steep correlation value that the averaged data boasts. Additionally, the 30 million dollar difference in spending between all teams in all seasons and just those that won the World Series in those seasons, indicates that winning teams tend to spend more money than others. The relationship between Payroll and Wins is a positive one, and owners wishing for their teams to compete must come to terms with this regardless of the size of the market they’re playing in; if you don’t want to spend money in an effort to truly put your best foot forward in competing for a World Series, sell the team to someone who will.\nLastly, we have the ultimate MLB data experience for any fan wishing to evaluate the trajectory of their team’s success since the turn of the century. It is here where we can observe individual team trends over time observing win total and payroll in chronological order.\nLet’s take a look: <iframe src=“https://rconnect.bucknell.edu/content/e2c721f4-1b89-4f74-917b-84fc2404ab6b” class=“l-screen-inset shaded” height=“1000px”>\n\n\n\n",
